# Skin Cancer Detection with Deep Learning

A deep learning model that classifies skin cancer types using dermatoscopic images.

## Features
- Trained on Kaggle's HAM10000 dataset
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow/Keras
- Includes preprocessing, augmentation, and regularization techniques
- Predicts multiple skin cancer types with class labels

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow, Keras
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for development and experimentation
- `model/` - Saved model and weights
- `data/` - Dataset reference (external)

## Status
- Model trained and evaluated
- Minor overfitting persists in certain classes

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - HAM10000 Skin Lesion Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)
