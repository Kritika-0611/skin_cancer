    Welcome to the Skin Cancer Detection System! üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüî¨

Our mission is to assist in the early detection of skin cancer by analyzing images of skin abnormalities. Upload an image of a mole or lesion, and our system will help identify potential signs of skin cancer. Together, we aim for healthier skin and early intervention!

### How It Works
1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Skin Cancer Detection** page and upload an image of a mole or skin lesion.
2. **Analysis:** Our system processes the image using advanced machine learning algorithms to detect possible signs of skin cancer.
3. **Results:** View detailed results along with medical recommendations for the next steps.

### Why Choose Us?
- **Accuracy:** Our model leverages cutting-edge deep learning techniques to provide reliable and precise skin cancer detection.
- **User-Friendly:** A simple and intuitive platform designed for ease of use.
- **Fast and Efficient:** Get results quickly to make timely decisions regarding skin health.

### Get Started
Click on the **Skin Cancer Detection** page in the sidebar, upload an image, and let our system guide you through the detection process!

    #### About Dataset
    This dataset has been meticulously curated and includes images of skin lesions for the purpose of skin cancer detection. The dataset is divided into various sets to support effective training and evaluation. 

The dataset consists of a total of 2,262 images categorized into different classes. It has been divided into training, validation, and test sets to ensure comprehensive model evaluation.

#### Content
1. **Train:** 1,792 images
2. **Validation:** 447 images
3. **Test:** 23 images

Each image in the dataset is labeled and organized to facilitate accurate training and testing of the skin cancer detection model. The dataset is designed to help in the efficient identification of skin cancer and to improve the overall accuracy of the detection system.
